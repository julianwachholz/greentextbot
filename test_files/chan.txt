>friend tells me about this new 4chan restaurant
\>be curious, check it out
\>it's this dark leaking restaurant, 20 blocks from the city centre but still crammed with people
\>not sure what to order, I order a random burger, the one that most of these people seem to eat
\>it's absolutely disgusting
\>look around see other people having the same horrible experience
\>some guy yells at me that his burger is delicious and way better than mine
\>see it's the same burger
\>yell back that mine is better and that he should go fuck himself
\>return to my burger
\>enjoy the rest of the horrifying burger
\>never leave the restaurant
